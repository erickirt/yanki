# Footnotes

## In footer

This is a simple footnote[^1]. And another[^2]. And another[^note].

## Inline

You can also use inline footnotes. ^[This is an inline footnote.]

[^1]: This is the referenced text.

[^2]:
    Add 2 spaces at the end of a new line.  
    This lets you write footnotes that span multiple lines.

[^note]: Named footnotes still appear as numbers, but can make it easier to identify and link references.
